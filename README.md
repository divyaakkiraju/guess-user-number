# guess-user-number
A game where the computer attempts to guess a user-generated number given prompts.

If the computer guesses a number that is too high, the user prompts the computer by telling it that it guessed too high. If the computer guesses a number that is too low, the user prompts the computer by telling it that it guessed too low. Using these prompts, the computer continues to guess until it guesses the number generated by the user.
